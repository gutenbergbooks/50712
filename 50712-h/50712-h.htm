fireplace with logs burning. Beyond it is a door. At the back is
another door and a mullioned window half open giving a glimpse of
bare garden hedge and winter sky. On the right wall is a staircase
running down from the ceiling into the room, a dresser and a light
shelf holding a book or two. Under the shelf is a small table piled
with papers, ink-stand, sand box and so on. At it sits</i> <span

is dark and slight. His voice is low, but, he speaks very clearly.

kisses, King of Hearts command all hands at court, but Ace in his

<p><span class="smcap">Child.</span> <span class="ws3_5">That’s right! That’s the way she cries in the play.
You see the man goes down to hell to find his wife, and the Fates
show her what’s going to happen while she’s waiting for him. She’s in
hell already, waiting and waiting. It takes years to travel through
hell. That’s her talking to the old man in rags and a crown.</span></p>

god of love. I wear a crown of roses and wings. They do tickle. Soon
I’ll be too big. So he and I go to the three Fates to get back his
wife. She isn’t pretty in that act. She’s all white and dead round
her eyes&mdash;like you.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Child.</span> <span class="ws3">After he sings
his beautiful song he does. Everybody has to listen when he sings.
Even the big dog lies down. Your husband made us a nice catch about
it yesterday. I like your husband. I’m glad he’s coming with us. Are
you coming with us?</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> <span class="ws3_5">No.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Child.</span> <span class="ws3">It’s a pity.
If you were a man you could act in the company. But women can’t act.
Even Orpheus’ wife is a boy really. So are the three Fates. They’re
friends of mine. Would you like to talk to them, the way we do in the
play? Come on! I go first, you see. You must say just what I tell
you.</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="blockquot_intro"> <i>A room at the Palace</i>. <span
class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>sits at a working table. She is
upright, vigorous, with an ivory white skin and piercing eyes. Her
hair is dark red and stiffly dressed. She is old, as an oak or a
cliff or a cathedral is old&mdash;there is no frailty of age in
her. Her gestures are measured, she moves very little, and frowns
oftener than she smiles, but her smile, when it does come, is
kindly. Her voice is strong, rather harsh, but clear. She speaks
her words like a scholar, but her manner is that of a woman of the
world, shrewd and easy. Her dress is a black-green brocade, stiff
with gold and embroidered with coloured stones. Beside her stands</i>
<span class="smcap">Henslowe</span>, <i>ten years older, stouter
and more prosperous. In the background</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Fitton</span>,
<i>a woman of twenty-six, sits at the virginals,
fingering out a tune very faintly and lightly. She is taller than</i>
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <i>pale, with black hair, a
smiling mouth and brilliant eyes. She is quick and graceful as a
cat, and her voice is the voice of a singer, low and full. She wears
a magnificent black and white dress with many pearls. A red rose is
tucked behind her ear.</i></p>

<p class="space-above1"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Money,
money! Always more money! Henslowe, you’re a leech! And I’m a Gammer
Gurton to let myself be bled. Let the public pay!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Madam, they’ll do that fast
enough if we may call ourselves Your Majesty’s Players.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> No, no, you’re not yet
proven. What do you give me? Good plays enough, but what great play?
What has England, what have I, to match against them when they talk
to me of their Tasso, their Petrarch, their Rabelais&mdash;of Divine
Comedies and the plays of Spain? Are we to climb no higher than the
Germans with their ‘Ship of Fools’?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> ‘The Faery Queen’?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Green&mdash;Peele&mdash;Kyd&mdash;Webster&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Stout English
names&mdash;not names for all the world. I will pay you no more good
English pounds a year and fib to my treasurer to account for them.
You head a deputation, do you? You would call yourselves the Queen’s
Players, and mount a crown on your curtains? Give me a great play
then&mdash;a royal play&mdash;a play to set against France and Italy
and Spain, and you can have your patent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> There’s ‘Tamburlaine’!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> A boy’s glory, not a man’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> ‘Faust’ and ‘The Jew of Malta’!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> I know them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> He’ll do greater things yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Do you believe that, Henslowe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> No, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Then why do you lie to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Madam, I mark time. I have my man;
but he is not yet ripe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> How long have you served me, Henslowe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Twelve years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> How often have you come to me in those
twelve years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Four times, Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Have I helped or hindered?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> I confess it, Madam, I have lived on your wits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Then who’s your man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> You’ll not trust me. He has done little
before the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Shakespeare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Madam, you know everything. Will you see him?
He and Marlowe are among our petitioners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> H’m! the Stratford boy! I have not forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Who could have promised better? He came to town
like a conqueror. He took us all with his laughter. You yourself,
Madam&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Yes, make us laugh and you may pick all pockets!
He helped you to pick mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> So far good. But he aims no
higher. Yet what he could do if he would! I have a sort of love of
him, Madam. I found him: I taught him: I have daughters enough but
no son. I have wrestled with him like Jacob at Peniel, but when I
think to conquer he tickles my rib and I laugh. That’s his weapon,
Madam! With his laughter he locks the door of his heart against every man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> And every woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> They say&mdash;no, Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Then we must find her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe</span> [<i>with a glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Fitton</span>].
They say she is found already. But a court lady&mdash;and a player! It’s
folly, Madam! Now Marlowe would shrug his shoulder and go elsewhere;
but Shakespeare&mdash;there is about him in little and great a certain
dogged and damnable constancy that wrecks all. If he cannot have the
moon for his supper, he will starve, Madam, whatever an old fool says
to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Then, Henslowe, we must serve him up the moon.
Mary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> [<i>rising and coming down to them</i>]. Madam?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> Could you hear us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> &emsp;&emsp;I was playing the new song that the Earl set for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> For me? But you heard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> &emsp;&emsp;Something of the talk, Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> You go to all the plays, do you not? Which is the
coming man, Mary, Shakespeare or Marlowe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> &emsp;&emsp;If you ask me, Madam, I’m all for the cobbler’s son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> Mistress Fitton should give us a sound reason if
she have it, but she has none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> &emsp;&emsp;Only that I don’t know Mr. Marlowe, and I know my
little Shakespeare by heart. I’m an Athenian&mdash;I’m always asking for

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> <span class="ws3">O Madam, spare me!
It’s a stiff instrument and once, I think, has been ill-tuned.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> <span class="ws3">You wish that, Madam?</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span> &emsp;Wonder, Mary! Wonder! And when you know why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
I do what I do you shall be Queen instead of me. In the meantime you
may learn the trade, if you choose. I give you a kingdom to rule
in the likeness of a poor player. Let me see how you do it! Yet
mark this&mdash;though with fair cheeks and black hair you may come by a
coronet (but the Earl goes to Ireland) yet if you rule your kingdom
by the glance of your eyes, you will lose it as other Maries have done.</p>

Well, try your way! But&mdash;between queens, Mary&mdash;one kingdom at a time!</p>

You are the quizzical Mr. Shakespeare of the ‘Rose,’ who never

because you are not of their union, and yet know the tricks of each
trade; but your own trade loves you, because you are content with a
crook in the lower branches when you might be top of the tree.
You write comedies, all wit and no wisdom, like a flower-bed raked

<i>The first performance of Romeo and Juliet: the end of the fourth
act. The curtain rises on a small bare dusty office, littered
with stage properties and dresses. When the door at the back of
the stage is open there is a glimpse of passage and curtains, and
moving figures, with now and then a flare of torchlight. There is a
continuous far-away murmur of voices and, once in a while, applause.

sir, says Mr. Henslowe. The end’s near and the house half mad. We’ve
not seen a night like this since&mdash;since <i>your</i> night, sir! Your first
night, sir, your roaring Tamburlaine night! Never anything like it
and I’ve seen many. Will you come, sirs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> You go, Marlowe!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stage Hand.</span> There’s nothing to fear,
sir! It runs like clockwork. The lady died well, sir! Lord, who’d
think she was a woman! There, there, it breaks out. Listen to ’em!

them away! I can stand no more.</p>

fling your luck away.</p>

Marlowe, my fruit’s black. Help me now! Go, go! Say I’m gone, as I
shall be when I’ve seen Mary&mdash;</p>

London in half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Earnest? For long?</p>

I’ve missed the moment. Who has his moment twice?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="blockquot_intro">
<span class="smcap">Shakespeare’s</span> <i>lodging. It is the
plain but well-arranged room of a man of fair means and fine
taste. The walls are panelled: on them hang a couple of unframed
engravings, a painting, tapestry, and a map of the known
world. There is a four-post bed with a coverlet and hangings
of needlework, and on the window-sill a pot of early summer
flowers. There is a chair or two of oak and a table littered
with papers</i>. <span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> <i>is sitting
at it, a manuscript in his hand. On the arm of the chair lolls</i>
<span class="smcap">Marlowe</span>, <i>one arm flung round</i> <span
class="smcap">Shakespeare’s</span> <i>neck, reading over his
shoulder.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Man, how you’ve worked! A
whole act to my ten lines! You dice all day and dance all night and
yet&mdash;how do you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Like it? What a word for
a word-master! Consider, Kit! When the sun rises like a battle song
over the sea: when the wind’s feet visibly race along the tree-tops
of a ten-mile wood: when they shout “Amen!” in the Abbey, praying for
the Queen on Armada Day: when the sky is a brass gong and the rain
steel rods, and across all suddenly arch the seven colours of the
promise&mdash;do I <i>like</i> these wonders when I stammer and weep, and
know that God lives? Like, Marlowe!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Yes, yes, old
Will! But do you like the new act?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> I like it, Kit!</p>

<p class="center">[<i>They look at each other and laugh</i>].
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;And now for your scene, ere I go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> My scene! I give you what I’ve done.
Finish it alone, Kit, and take what it brings! I’m sucked dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;I’ve heard that before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> I wish I had never come to London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Henslowe’s back. Seen him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> I’ve seen no-one. Did the tour go well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;He says so. He left them at Stratford.
Well, I must go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Where? To Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Why should I go to your Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Because I’ve asked you to, often enough. Why
else? You’ve grown to be friends. You could help me if you would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Never step between a man and a woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> But you’re our friend! And they say you
know women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;They say many things. They say we’re rivals,
Will&mdash;that I shall end by having you hissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Let them say! But have you seen Mary?
When did you last see Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;I forget. Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Did you speak of me, Kit? Kit,
does she speak of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;If you must have
it&mdash;seldom. New songs, new books, new music&mdash;of plays and
players and the Queen’s tantrums&mdash;not of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> I have not seen her three days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Why, go then and see her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> She has company. She
is waiting on the Queen. She gives me a smile and a white cool
finger-tip, and&mdash;“Farewell, Mr. Shakespeare!” Yet a month ago,
ay and less than a month&mdash;! Did you give her my message? What
did she say?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;She laughed and says you dream.
She never liked you better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Did she say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;She says you cool to her, not she to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Did she say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Swore it, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Is it so? I wish it were so. Well, you’re my
good friend, Marlowe!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Oh, leave that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Kit, do you blame me so much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Why should I blame you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> That I’m here and not in Warwickshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;I throw no stones. Why? Have you heard aught?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> No, nor dared
ask&mdash;nor dared ask, Marlowe. The boy’s dead. I know it. But I
will not hear it. Marlowe, Marlowe, Marlowe, do you judge me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Ay, that
putting your hand to the plough you look back. Would I comb out my
conscience daily as a woman combs out her hair? I do what I choose,
though it damn me! Blame you? The round world has not such another
Mary&mdash;or so, had I your eyes, I should hold. For this prize, if
I loved her, I would pay away all I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Honour, Kit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Honour, Will!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Faith and conscience and an only son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;It’s my own life. What are children to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Well, I have paid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;But you
grudge&mdash;you grudge! Look at you! If you go to her with those
eyes it’s little wonder that she tires of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Tires? Who says that she
tires? Who says it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Not I, old Will!
Not I! Why, Shakespeare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> [<i>shaken</i>]. &emsp;I can’t sleep,
Kit! has come to me? I think I go mad. [<i>He starts.</i>] Was that the

I can’t write. What boy on the stairs? I sent him to her. I wrote.
I have waited her will long enough. She shall see me to-night. I’ll
know what it means. She plays with me, Kit. Are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;I shall scarce reach Deptford ere dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> How long do you lodge in Deptford?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;All summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe</span> [<i>pounding at the door</i>].
Who’s at home? Who’s at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;That’s Henslowe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> Why does the boy stay so long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe</span> [<i>in the doorway</i>].
&emsp;Gentlemen, the traveller returns! For the last time, I tell
you! My bones grow too old for barnstorming. Do you go as I come,
Kit? Thank you for nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;Be civil,
Henslowe! ‘The Curtain’ ’s on its knees to me for my next play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> &emsp; Pooh! This man can serve my turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe.</span> &emsp;&ensp;You see, they’ll
make rivals of us, Will, before they’ve done. I’ll see you soon
again. [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> &emsp; Well, what’s the
news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> I sit at home. You roam
England. You can do the talking. How did the tour go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> &emsp; You’re thin, man!
What’s the matter? Success doesn’t suit you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> How did the tour go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span> &emsp; By way of Oxford,
Warwick, Kenilworth&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span> I said “how” not
“where.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henslowe.</span>&emsp; &mdash;and Leamington
and Stratford. We played ‘Romeo’ every other night&mdash;and to full
houses, my son! I’ve a pocketful of money for you. They liked you
everywhere. As for your townsfolk, they went mad. You can safely go
home, boy! You’ll find Sir Thomas in the front row, splitting his
gloves. He’ll ask you to dinner.

we close down. Another tragedy? No, no, no, we don’t ask that of

Oh, you can do it in your sleep! Lovers and lasses, and quarrels and

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
